# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this school data audit was the school board discovered evidence of academic dishonestly. Thomas High School ninth graders reading, and math grades have been altered.  The school board has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with Nans while we kept the rest for the data intact. 
	
## Results

### How is the district summary affected? 
The average math scored changed from 78.9 to 79.0 in the new school district summary. The average reading score stayed the same. The % passing math change from 74.8% to 75%. The % passing reading change from 85.7% to 86%. The % overall passing changed from 64.95 to 65%. These changes were small but noticeable.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Replacing the 9th graders scores and only then only counting 10th – 12th grade did not affect the test scores as much when we still included Nans in the data. The average math score changed from 83.41 to 83.35. The average reading score changed from 83.84 to 84.89. Thomas high School had an 9063% overall passing after removing the 9th grader data.
